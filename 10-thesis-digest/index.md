# Digest: Game Design - Essence of soulslike games
## Abstract
In my thesis i am writing about game design in general and then dive into the topic of soulslike games a very specific genre which consists of keeping the player challenged at all times. I analyze the psychology behind this genre - how it affects the player, why more players like these types of games, how player can be better at this genre and how to make a game as a solo developer in this genre. And also the market analysis.
## Keywords
- challenge, game design, indie developer, psychology, soulslike
## Main text
My thesis is about indie game development, its marketing and focusing more on souls like genre in depth. This genre of games consists of keeping the player challenged at all times. I am explaining why players like this genre so much, why is it so popular, what is it doing to human body and how it appears on the market. Purpose of this project is to analyze soulslike games as a psychological subject and create my own soulslike game as an indie developer. I am analyzing the market on big game platforms (steam, epic games...), writing from my experience of this genre, testing and getting feedback from players playing this type of games and playing my own game. Understanding how soulslike games work and how to apply this know-how to new games is crucial. As a result I would like to create a new soulslike game based on this research and make its distribution.
## About the game
My game is a sci-fi soulslike 2D platformer, story driven rpg. Story of the game revolves around planet earth being destroyed by humans and thus creating a space exploration team to a find a new suitable planet for humans to live on. The crew of the exploration team encounters some obstacles on their journey and it depends on our main character if he decides to countinue to save humanity.
## Images
Here I am going to show you some screenshots from my game (even though it would be much easier to show the game itself).

I also wanted to make a unique website for my game. The website is also a little minigame, you begin at the bottom and gotta keep scrolling up to launch the spaceship into the outer space. Then you can explore other planets just like the crew in my game. Once you select a planet you can drive there with a rover.
