This genre of games consists of keeping the player challenged at all times. I am explaining why players like this genre so much, why is it so popular, what is it doing to human body and how it appears on the market. Purpose of this project is to analyze soulslike games as a psychological subject and create my own soulslike game as an indie developer. Analyzing the market on big game platforms (steam, epic games...), writing from my experience of this genre, testing and getting feedback from players playing this type of games and playing my own game. Understanding how soulslike games work and how to apply this know-how to new games. Creating a new soulslike game based on this research and making its distribution.
