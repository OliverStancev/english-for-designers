## About me
Hi, I am Oliver - a designer who does a little bit of everything.

![Me](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79570724/139725966-d34eb5e2-d1dc-4e07-b1e4-4401060b20c5.jpg)

## My story
Back in 2010 I was an aspiring youtuber making gameplay videos with commentary and really liked the process of creating stuff. I learned how to edit videos and also how to make graphic content and animations for my youtube channel. I ended my youtube career few years after but I fell in love with content creation and it somehow stucked with me.
When I was thinking about what should I do in my life I went for my hobby despite my mother wanting me to attend a medical school and I regret nothing so far.

## Other activities
When my photoshop isn't open I am probably out with my friends, heavy lifting in the gym or grinding my rank in League of Legends.
