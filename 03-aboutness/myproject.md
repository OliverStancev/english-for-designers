# My Project
# KP Nails
This was a logo and package design for a shop with custom press-on nails.

## Moodboard
The client wanted a witch, magic, esoteric themed design so we started with a moodboard.

## Draft
Then we talked a lot about the design, we needed to define the feel of her company and I made some versions of the logo.

## Feedback
She was happy with a certain design but I could see that it wasn't perfect in her eyes so we discussed the logo again and I redesigned her new vision get rif all her problems.

## Final version and mockups
This was the final version of the logo she was very happy about.

Versions of the cover.

## Conclusion
I communicated a lot with the client and together we created something that was perfect as her vision. Hope we will work together again in the future.
