This is something I do every year for my highschool where I studied. I started doing these tickets when I had my prom, we got some very ugly tickets that no one liked from a local graphic designer, so my class and the other class asked me if I could od it and everyone liked it <3
### Design nummer zwei - CD cover for my dear friend

My friend is a really talented guitar player and he recorded his own cd with guitar covers afterwards he had a big non-profitable concert where he was giving out those cds for free.

Probably my first big gig. A new asian bistro in my hometown was looking for some graphic work - menus, business cards, leaflets, posters, web, etc. they also needed a little rebranding and a stable identity.
