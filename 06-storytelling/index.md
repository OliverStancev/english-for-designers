# My design story
by Oliver Stančev

Why do you love what you do?
- I love coming up with fresh ideas and creating new solutions for all sorts of things. I love to entertain / educate / inspire / motivate with my design and I am always pleased with a positive feedback (but you can't grow without a negative one). 

What do you believe in? What’s your design philosophy?
- I believe creativity and expressing yourself is one of the best ways how to contribute to a world. I love design that has a purpose or utility.

Who or what inspires you? Where does your inspiration come from?
- I don't think I have a role model that would inspire me so much. But I always get inspiration from the internet - that's what I like about living in 21st century - researching is so fast and you get inspiration from anything. I also get motivation by competing with my peers.

When was that aha moment?
- That aha moment was building up everytime I did something creative for my highschool and got appreciated.
