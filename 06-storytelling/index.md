# My journey
by Oliver Stančev

## 2010 - The beginning
Back in 2010 I was an aspiring youtuber making gameplay videos with commentary and really liked the process of creating stuff. I learned how to edit videos and also how to make graphic content and animations for my youtube channel. I ended my youtube career few years after but I fell in love with content creation and it somehow stucked with me.

## 2013 - Design break
In 2013 I didn't really think of graphic design as a proffesion but more as a hobby, I never knew people can make actual money from this and because of that a didn't pursue this job but focus on school and try to discover other jobs that might interest me. I took a break from graphic design and did something only very occasionaly or during art classes.
## 2016 - Picking up where I stopped
When my highschool years were coming to an end I had to decide what am I gonna do after school. I realised I should do something useful, non-repetetive, fun, challenging and most importantly something I am passionate about. After some reconsideration and encouraging from friends I found only one answer - Graphic Design. So I picked up where I stopped, found new clients, make some new work and create my very first portfolio that would help to get into a desgin school.

## 2019 - Full commiting to design
In 2019 I was something like a school designer. If anyone needed anything to design they knew they could turn to me. I was happy I could learn new stuff and grow my portfolio. When I was searching for a design school I really liked VŠKK the most because of their modern approach to design unlike other design school that seemed more traditional.

## 2022 - Present
And now we are here. 12 years after my first design attempt. I am in my last year of school and deciding whether to continue studying or go to full time working. Finishing my bachelors work as a game designer and really enjoying it. Also I have a part-time job as a designer in a big casino company and I really like the job.

What future holds is the question. :)

# Interview with myself
Why do you love what you do?
- I love coming up with fresh ideas and creating new solutions for all sorts of things. I love to entertain / educate / inspire / motivate with my design and I am always pleased with a positive feedback (but you can't grow without a negative one). 

What do you believe in? What’s your design philosophy?
- I believe creativity and expressing yourself is one of the best ways how to contribute to a world. I love design that has a purpose or utility.

Who or what inspires you? Where does your inspiration come from?
- I don't think I have a role model that would inspire me so much. But I always get inspiration from the internet - that's what I like about living in 21st century - researching is so fast and you get inspiration from anything. I also get motivation by competing with my peers.

When was that aha moment?
- That aha moment was building up everytime I did something creative for my highschool and got appreciated.
