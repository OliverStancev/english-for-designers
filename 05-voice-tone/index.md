# Voice & Tone

When I am about to present something to a client I always think about my presentation and try to be prepared for anything. Voice and tone is my go to guideline how to be prepared for a client and how to proceed in any situation.

## Voice
I am trying to show creativity and inspiration with my presentation. Strong and confident but not intimidating to show I know what I am talking about and I am genuinely excited about the topic, not just reading slides.


I always try to:

1. Set positive vibe
2. Be excited about presenting
3. Do strong impression

## Tone

My tone changes when I talk to different audiences. For example when I have a presentation in class and my audience consists of my classmates., then I am informal, funny, relatable and try to make the presentation very brief.
If my audince is a client from a big company, then my presentation is formal and I am trying to be proffesional but ALWAYS SHOW SOME EMOTIONS!
