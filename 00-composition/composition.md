# Instructions into pictures

### INSTRUCTIONS 01
Step1: 	Draw a diagonal rectangle (from lower to higher) about 2 cm wide and 13 cm long in the middle of your paper

Step2:	Draw 3 circles into the left side of the rectangle and fill the middle one, leave other circles blank. Each circle is 2 cm apart from each other.

All circles are aligned in one diagonal line (don't draw the line just imagine it!)

Step3:	Draw 1 circle in the right side of the rectangle (1cm from the right end)

Step4:	Draw 1 circle outside the rectangle near the right end (1cm from the right end)
It should look like a flute when finished

### INSTRUCTIONS 02
In the picture we can see two objects. The first object is a shape of a house. The second object is vertically oriented rectangle, it looks like a chimney, it is about 2 centimeters higher than the top of the house (roof). The rectangle is located in the shape of the house, not in the middle, but a little bit on the right side, it is connected with lower line of the house and its lift line is slightly overlapping over the roof. Together in the end it should look like a church.

### INSTRUCTIONS 03
You are going to draw 5 rectangles next to each other in the middle of the paper. The width of each rectangle is the same which is about 1,5cm. The height of the rectangles is different. They are evenly spaced. The space in between is about 0,5cm.

Step 1:	The first one is the shortest one and is about 4cm.

Step 2:	The second one is taller. The bottom of the first and second rectangle is on the same line (level)

Step 3:	The third one is the ... ... as the scond one but the top of the rectangle is on the same line as the tip of the first one.

Step 4:	The bottom of the fourth one is one the same line as the first and second one. It is at least 6cm tall.

Step 5:	The fifth one is the tallest. Its ... is on the same line as the second one and its bottom is on the same line as the third one.

All rectangles are white with black outline. Only the fourth one is black.
